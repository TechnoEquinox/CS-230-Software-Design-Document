# CS-230-Software-Design-Document

This repo was the major assignment for my CS 230: Operating Platforms class at Southern New Hampshire University.

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

    The Gaming Room is a client developing a web-based version of their Androud game _Draw It or Lose It_, to expand accessibility across multiple different platforms. They requested a design that supportes multiple players across different software platforms, supports unique team and player names, and maintains one game instance to improve scalability and the user experience.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

   In the documentation, I excelled at detailing the design components of the project. This includes cross-platform requirements, design constraints, and specific recommendations for security and memory management. When discussing the specifics of the design, I am able to break down complicated topics that supports both the client's understanding while at the same time providing a clear direction for the development team.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

   Working through the design document helped to clarify the system requirements, constraints and dependencies that the software project will encounter during it's development. This can help to streamline coding by identifying the potential challenges in the platform early in the design phase which can in turn guide better coding practices and processes.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

   I would refine the System Architecture View through the addition of specific diagrams to illustrate the client-server data flow. The system architecture view was not originally part of this assignment and hence was not included in this document. I believe this additon would make the architecture more intuitive, aiding developers in visualizing the interaction between the front-end and back-end systems. 

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

   I interpreted the need for cross-platform access, secure data handling, and reliable performance as essential for the client's satisfaction. Designing with these needs in mind ensures the software remains accessible, responsive, and secure, which is crucial for maintaining a competitive multiplayer game.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

    My approach involves breaking down requirements into specific, manageable components and using object-oriented principles to structure each feature requested by the client. In the future, I would continue this structured approach while enhancing it with more user feedback loops during the design phase to ensure the final product aligns even more closely with user expectations.
